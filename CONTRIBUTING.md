## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a feature branch from `master`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes following our coding standards

3. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass and add new tests for your changes
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   go test -race ./...
   ```

4. **Document**: Update documentation and examples as needed

5. **Commit**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add RSS feed validation support"
   ```

6. **Push**: Push your branch to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request against the `master` branch

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure CI checks pass
- Be responsive to feedback

## Coding Standards

### Go Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `go fmt` for formatting
- Use `go vet` for static analysis
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Organize code into logical packages
- Avoid deep nesting

### Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use custom error types when appropriate
- Don't ignore errors

### Example

```go
// AddItem adds a feed item with validation.
func (f *Feed) AddItem(item Item) error {
    if err := item.Validate(); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid feed item: %w", err)
    }
    
    f.items = append(f.items, item)
    return nil
}
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new code must include tests
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)
- Write both unit and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Test Structure

- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies

## Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples in the `examples/` directory
